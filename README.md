## Purpose:
This project is an attempt at replicating the results in Vulnerability Detection in C, C++ Code with Deep Learning, Huang.  
Furthermore, we are interested in cross-analyzing the results from their work.  

Specifically, we aim to compare the comparative accuracy, specificity, and recall of three distinct models, and two types of optimizers in the hopes of enhancing their conclusions.

## Method:
1. We began by creating an environment to be able to first run the source code as provided by the researchers - this is what is contained in the file "env.yml".  
2. Next, we added a function to be able to generate a bidirectional Recurrent Neural Network.  
3. Finally, we modified the source "Application_codes" file to aggregate and output data for each pair of model and optimizer.  
Note - files for steps 2 and 3 can be found in the "Code" directory.

## Results & Conclusions:
